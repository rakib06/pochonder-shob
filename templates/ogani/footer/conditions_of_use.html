        our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item
        sold by Pochonder Shob is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for
        instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other merchants may
        follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.
        We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or, for

    <h4 id="condition_header">DISPUTES</h4>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Pochonder Shob
            Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Pochonder Shob or through Pochonder Shob.com
            will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court,</span> except that you may assert claims in
        small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this
        agreement.
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
            award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a
            court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these
            Conditions of Use as a court would.
            <br>
            <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your
                claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company 48, Khan jahan Ali Road, Khulna., Pochonder
                Shob will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims
                are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
                submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted
                    only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.</span>Â If for
                any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration <span>we each waive any right to a jury
                    trial.</span> We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or
                other misuse of intellectual property rights.
